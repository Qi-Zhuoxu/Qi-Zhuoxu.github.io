I earned my bachelor’s degree in Urban and Rural Planning from Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology (https://cn.xauat.edu.cn/), and completed both my master’s and PhD in Urban and Rural Planning at Southeast University (https://www.seu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Academician Duan Jin (Chinese Academy of Sciences, https://arch.seu.edu.cn/dj/main.psp). During my PhD, I participated in a one-year joint doctoral training program at the National University of Singapore (https://www.nus.edu.sg/), supervised by Professor Heng Chye Kiang (https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/staffs/heng-chye-kiang-dr/).

My research focuses on space genes and public perception, and further integrates topics such as place attachment, visual landscapes, and the urban thermal environment. I combine classical planning theories with multi-source spatiotemporal data (e.g., land-use data and social media data) and quantitative methods such as machine learning and natural language processing. In related projects, I can independently conduct data collection, model-based analysis, and academic writing.
