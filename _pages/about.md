I earned my bachelor’s degree in Urban and Rural Planning from Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology (https://cn.xauat.edu.cn/), and completed both my master’s and PhD in Urban and Rural Planning at Southeast University (https://www.seu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Academician Duan Jin (Chinese Academy of Sciences). During my PhD, I participated in a one-year joint doctoral training program at the National University of Singapore, supervised by Professor Heng Chye Kiang.
My research focuses on space genes and public perception, and further integrates topics such as place attachment, visual landscapes, and the urban thermal environment. I combine classical planning theories with multi-source spatiotemporal data (e.g., land-use data and social media data) and quantitative methods such as machine learning and natural language processing. In related projects, I can independently conduct data collection, model-based analysis, and academic writing.
